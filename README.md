Quick Install
-------------

Run the script directly from GitHub for a one‚Äëtime execution. The script guides you through setup.

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nima786/nftables-firewall-manager/main/firewall-manager.sh | sudo bash
    

This tool manages its own rules in a dedicated `inet firewall-manager` table, without touching Docker/UFW/system tables. It persists its config to `/etc/nftables.d/firewall-manager.nft` and ensures an `include` in `/etc/nftables.conf`.

Why This Script (vs. UFW & older frontends)?
--------------------------------------------

*   **Modern engine:** Uses `nftables` (the successor to iptables) for cleaner syntax and better performance.
*   **True default‚Äëdeny everywhere:** _input, forward, output_ chains have `policy drop`, giving real egress control (UFW is typically inbound‚Äëonly).
*   **Pre‚ÄëDocker priority:** Rules are installed at priority `-10` so they evaluate _before_ Docker‚Äôs default chains. You stay in control even with containers.
*   **Efficient big blocklists:** Uses kernel _sets_ with `flags interval` and chunked loading; thousands of CIDRs are matched in O(1) set lookups. Way faster than listing individual rules.
*   **Separation of concerns:** Lives in its own table, never clobbers Docker/UFW/system rules.
*   **Smart UX:** Menus for inbound (panel/inbounds) and outbound (system/nodes/APIs) ports, plus automatic SSH detection and brute‚Äëforce throttling.

* * *

Features
--------

*   üõ°Ô∏è **Strict by default:** `input`, `forward`, `output` all default to `drop`.
*   üîê **SSH safety:** Auto‚Äëdetects SSH port and applies a dynamic set to rate‚Äëlimit new attempts (anti‚Äëbrute‚Äëforce).
*   üåê **Outbound control:** Minimal essentials are allowed by default: `udp` _53_ (DNS), `udp` _123_ (NTP), `tcp` _22_ (SSH), and `tcp` _80,443_ (HTTP/S) with a rate‚Äëlimit. Everything else is blocked unless you explicitly allow it via the menu.
*   üì¶ **Docker‚Äëaware:** Allows bridged interfaces (e.g., `docker0`, `br-*`) in `forward` so containers keep working while your host remains locked down.
*   üö´ **High‚Äëperformance blocklist:** Downloads an IPv4 abuse/bogon list, prunes/merges CIDRs, and _loads in chunks_ into a kernel set after the table is created. Fast lookups, low CPU.
*   üß† **Resilient loading:** If Python/ipaddress pruning isn‚Äôt available, it falls back to the raw list; duplicates are de‚Äëduplicated; the set is flushed before reload to avoid errors.
*   üß© **Non‚Äëdestructive:** Only its own table is created/removed. No changes to Docker/UFW/system tables.
*   üìù **Clear logging:** Drops are logged with prefixes (`[NFT DROP in/out/fwd]`) for quick auditing.
*   üßΩ **Clean uninstall:** Removes only its table, persisted file, config (optionally the script itself).

* * *

Compatibility & Coexistence
---------------------------

*   **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04, Debian 11/12.
*   **IP version:** Rules run in `inet` family. The dynamic blocklist focuses on IPv4 (IPv6 default‚Äëdeny still applies unless you open ports).
*   **Docker:** Safe alongside Docker; our table runs at priority `-10` (before Docker‚Äôs default rules at `0`), and bridged interfaces are accommodated.
*   **UFW:** Can coexist, but if you want _one_ source of truth, disable UFW: `sudo ufw disable`. This script does _not_ modify UFW automatically.

* * *

Permanent Installation
----------------------

Install once and rerun anytime:

    # Download
    sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nima786/nftables-firewall-manager/main/firewall-manager.sh -o /usr/local/bin/firewall-manager
    
    # Make executable
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/firewall-manager
    
    # Run
    sudo firewall-manager
    

On the first run, dependencies are installed, a config directory is created, and the blocklist is fetched.

* * *

Important Defaults
------------------

*   **Inbound:** Only your detected SSH port is allowed by default. Add panel/inbound ports via the menu.
*   **Outbound:** Defaults allow DNS(53/udp), NTP(123/udp), SSH(22/tcp), HTTP/HTTPS(80/443 tcp, rate‚Äëlimited). Add node/API ports via the menu if needed.
*   **Persistence:** Rules are written to `/etc/nftables.d/firewall-manager.nft` and included from `/etc/nftables.conf`.

* * *

Menu Options Explained
----------------------

*   **1) View Current Firewall Rules** ‚Äî Shows only the `firewall-manager` table (and prints the `blocked_ips` set for visibility).
*   **2) Apply Firewall Rules from Config** ‚Äî Builds and applies rules from config files; loads the blocklist set in chunks; then persists.
*   **3) Allow TCP Inbound Ports (For Panel/Inbounds)** ‚Äî Add/remove TCP ports or ranges for _incoming_ traffic.
*   **4) Allow UDP Inbound Ports (For Panel/Inbounds)** ‚Äî Add/remove UDP ports or ranges for _incoming_ traffic.
*   **5) Manage Blocked IPs** ‚Äî Add/remove IPv4 addresses/CIDRs in your blocklist file.
*   **6) Update IP Blocklist from Source** ‚Äî Fetch the latest IPv4 abuse list and save it locally (applies on next ‚Äú2) Apply‚Äù).
*   **7) Allow Outbound Ports (For System/Nodes/APIs)** ‚Äî Add/remove TCP/UDP _egress_ ports (e.g., node control/API ports).
*   **8) Flush All Rules & Reset Config** ‚Äî Deletes only the `firewall-manager` table and resets this tool‚Äôs config (other nftables tables untouched).
*   **9) Uninstall Firewall & Script** ‚Äî Removes the table, persisted file, config, and the script itself.
*   **0) Exit**

* * *

Configuration Files
-------------------

All configuration lives under `/etc/firewall_manager_nft/`:

*   `allowed_tcp_ports.conf` ‚Äî Inbound TCP allowlist
*   `allowed_udp_ports.conf` ‚Äî Inbound UDP allowlist
*   `allowed_node_tcp_ports.conf` ‚Äî Outbound TCP allowlist
*   `allowed_node_udp_ports.conf` ‚Äî Outbound UDP allowlist
*   `blocked_ips.conf` ‚Äî IPv4 blocklist (downloaded/merged)

* * *

Verification & Troubleshooting
------------------------------

    # View rules managed by this tool
    sudo nft list table inet firewall-manager
    
    # See the full ruleset (including Docker)
    sudo nft list ruleset
    
    # Check SSH brute-force dynamic set
    sudo nft list set inet firewall-manager ssh_brute
    
    # Inspect blocklist set
    sudo nft list set inet firewall-manager blocked_ips | head -n 100
    
    # View drops (input/output/forward)
    journalctl -k | grep "NFT DROP"
    

**Tip:** If you want this tool to be your single firewall authority, consider disabling UFW (`sudo ufw disable`) to avoid policy confusion.

* * *

Emergency Rollback
------------------

Remove only this tool‚Äôs table (Docker/UFW/system rules remain):

    sudo nft delete table inet firewall-manager
    

* * *

Performance Notes
-----------------

*   Blocklists are stored in a kernel _set_, not as one rule per IP. Lookups are extremely fast.
*   `flags interval` and pruning merge overlapping CIDRs, minimizing memory and comparisons.
*   Established/related traffic is accepted early, so most packets never hit expensive checks.

* * *

Requirements
------------

*   Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
*   `sudo` privileges
*   Internet access (first run + blocklist updates)

* * *

* * *

What‚Äôs New in v3.9.5
--------------------

*   Robust, chunked blocklist loading (after table creation) with prune fallback and safe deduplication.
*   Outbound allowlist menu (System/Nodes/APIs) + minimal default egress allows with HTTP/HTTPS rate‚Äëlimit.
*   Runs at priority `-10` to evaluate before Docker rules.
*   Removed redundant `daddr` blocklist check from `INPUT` (kept in `FORWARD`/`OUTPUT`), preserving strictness while trimming one lookup.
*   Persists rules _after_ loading the blocklist set for reliable reboots.
